Various examples, node blocks, graphs, assets and scripts I've made for VNyan that doesn't have anywhere else to go :3 I wont link absolutely everything on this page, but I'll link and highlight some key things I think are the most interesting.

Much of this you are free to learn from or use. I wont put a license for the whole repo, but will leave licenes inside specific subsets where applicable.

## [Graphs](./Graphs)
VNyan graphs and setups that involve more than just a single codeblock. Some things here are stuff we made long ago that we don't use anymore, or examples we made for others

## [Guides](./Guides)
Different examples or guides I've put together over time and shared
- [Lattice Modifier Blink Squish](./Guides/Lattice-Modifier)

## [Node Blocks](./NodeBlocks)
Different methods, setups and effects that can fit and be shared into 1 or 2 blocks :3
